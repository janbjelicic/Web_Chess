# Web_Chess
This project was created and delivered as a part of my bachelors degree thesis.
This is a web application written in C#, framework ASP.NET MVC 4. 
The best way to run it is to use VS 2012.
Application represents a chess website where you can playout chess games, see popular openings, endgames, strategies and also comment on them.
The feature that I was working on the most is chess problems solving.
